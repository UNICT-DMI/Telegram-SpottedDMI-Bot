## ü§ñ Telegram bot setup

If you want to deploy your own version of this bot, you will need to have a telegram bot available. You should read [this guide](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot) for more details, but in short:

- Send a message to [@Botfather](https://t.me/botfather)
- Follow the guided procedure
- You will recieve a token. Whoever knows that token has complete control over your bot, so handle it with care
- You will need that token later, for it is a needed value in the settings

## üíª Setting up a local istance

#### System requirements

- [Python 3 (3.9)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- python-pip3

#### Install with _pip3_

Listed in requirements.txt.  
The main ones are:

- [python-telegram-bot](https://pypi.org/project/python-telegram-bot/)
- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
- [PyYAML](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/)

### Steps:

- Clone this repository
- \[_OPTIONAL_\] Create _"data/yaml/reactions.yaml"_ and edit the desired parameters.
- Create [_"config/settings.yaml"_](#‚öôÔ∏è-settings) and edit the desired parameters. **Make sure to add a valid _token_ setting**.
- Make sure the bot is in present both in the admin group and in the spot channel. It may need to have admin privileges. If comments are enabled, the bot has to be in the comment group too as an admin.
- What follows are some example settings with explaination for each:

- **Run** `python3 main.py`

## üê≥ Setting up a Docker container

#### System requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### Steps:

- Clone this repository
- \[_OPTIONAL_\] Create _"data/yaml/reactions.yaml"_ and edit the desired parameters.
- Create [_"config/settings.yaml"_](<(#‚öôÔ∏è-settings)>) and edit the desired parameters. **Make sure to add a valid _token_ setting**.
- \[_OPTIONAL_\] You could also leave the settings files alone, and use the environment variables on the container instead.
- Make sure the bot is in present both in the admin group and in the spot channel. It may need to have admin privileges. If comments are enabled, the bot has to be in the comment group too as an admin.
- All the env vars with the same name (case insensitive) will override the ones in the settings file.
  To update the **meme** settings, prefix the env var name with **MEME\_**. The same is true for the **test** settings, that have to be prefixed with **TEST\_**.
- **Run** `docker build --tag botimage .`
- **Run** `docker run -d --name botcontainer -e TOKEN=<token_arg> [other env vars] botimage`

### Examples

First run

```bash
docker build --tag botimage .
```

Then something like

```bash
docker run -d --name botcontainer -e TOKEN=<token_arg> -e MEME_CHANNEL_ID=-4 -e MEME_GROUP_ID=-5 TEST_TOKEN=<token_test> botimage
```

### To stop/remove the container:

- **Run** `docker stop botcontainer` to stop the container
- **Run** `docker rm -f botcontainer` to remove the container

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings

When the bot is initialized, the bot reads both the _"data/yaml/reactions.yaml"_ and the _"config/settings.yaml"_ files.  
Feel free to customize the settings file. Make sure to add a valid **token** value to run the bot.

_settings.yaml_

    true
    # whether the bot should replace any anonymous comment with a message by itself.

  replace_anonymous_comments: false
